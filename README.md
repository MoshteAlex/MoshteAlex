### :man_technologist: Me :
My focus particularly lies in embedded software development, IoT, PCB design and their derivatives. I am also a physics enthusiast studying it for fun. I consider myself to be an electronics engineer dedicated to the pursuit of realizing a sustainably efficient world through technology and more so in electronics engineering. I learn skills and create projects that I showcase here and on LinkedIn.
